<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p> I am currently at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> and this site is to write about my learnings in machine learning, statistics and other related subjects. </p>

<p> I have been in the sustainability and built environment space for about five years, since my senior year of college. I worked as an energy analyst in engineering/consulting, where we researched ways to make buildings more energy efficient and lessen their climate impacts. I am deeply concerned about climate change! </p>

<p> On a day to day, I enjoy doing analysis and coding. I have been spending much of Recurse Center learning about deep learning. Outside of my room, you can find me at the bouldering gym or eating chocolate :) </p><br>
