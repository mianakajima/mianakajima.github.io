I"£<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I used to work as an energy anaylst in engineering/consulting, where we researched ways to make buildings more energy efficient and lessen their climate impacts. I am currently at the Recurse Center, trying to transition into applying data analytics to climate change and sustainability.</p>

<p>This site is to write about my learnings in machine learning, statistics and other related subjects.</p>
