Hello!

I am currently at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and this site is to write about my learnings in machine learning, statistics and other related subjects.

I have been in the sustainability and built environment space for about five years, since my senior year of college. I worked as an energy analyst in engineering/consulting, where we researched ways to make buildings more energy efficient and lessen their climate impacts. I am deeply concerned about climate change! 

On a day to day, I enjoy doing analysis and coding. I have been spending much of Recurse Center learning about deep learning. Outside of my room, you can find me at the bouldering gym or eating chocolate :)
