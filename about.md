Hello!

I used to work as an energy analst in engineering/consulting, where we researched and proposed ways to make buildings more energy efficient and lessen their climate impacts. I am currently at the Recurse Center, trying to transition into applying data analytics to climate change and sustainability.

This site is to write about my learnings in machine learning, statistics and other related subjects.
